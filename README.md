This script is a Bash script designed to synchronize two directories, referred to as the "master" and "slave" directories, using rsync over SSH. Here's a breakdown of its components:

1. Variables
MASTER_DIR and SLAVE_DIR: Paths to the master and slave directories.
LOG_FILE: Path to the log file where sync operations are logged.
IDENTITY_FILE: Path to the SSH identity file for authentication.
2. Functions
log_message(): Logs messages with timestamps to the log file.
sync_directories(): Performs synchronization between master and slave directories in both directions.
is_master_online(): Checks if the master directory's host is online using ping.
get_latest_timestamp(): Retrieves the latest file timestamp from the slave directory using SSH and find.
decide_sync_direction(): Decides the sync direction based on the latest file timestamps in both directories.
3. Main Logic
Directory Monitoring: Uses inotifywait to monitor the master directory for changes and triggers synchronization when changes are detected.
Sync Decision: If the master is online, it decides the sync direction based on file timestamps and performs the sync accordingly. If the master is offline, it waits and retries.

Key Points
Logging: All operations are logged with timestamps.
Synchronization: Uses rsync to synchronize directories, ensuring files are up-to-date in both directions.
Decision Making: Determines sync direction based on file timestamps to ensure the latest files are always synchronized.
Monitoring: Continuously monitors the master directory for changes and triggers synchronization accordingly.
